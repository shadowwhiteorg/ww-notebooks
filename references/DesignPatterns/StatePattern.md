# State Pattern

The State Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern is particularly useful in game development for managing complex state-dependent behavior, such as character states (e.g., idle, running, jumping) in Unity.

## Key Concepts

- **Context**: The class that has a state and whose behavior changes based on the state.
- **State**: An interface or abstract class that defines the behavior associated with a particular state of the Context.
- **Concrete States**: Classes that implement the State interface and define specific behaviors for each state.

## Example: Character State Management

Let's create a simple example where a character can be in different states: Idle, Running, and Jumping.

### Step 1: Define the State Interface

```csharp
// ICharacterState.cs
public interface ICharacterState
{
    void EnterState(Character character);
    void UpdateState(Character character);
    void ExitState(Character character);
}
```

### Step 2: Implement Concrete States

```csharp
// IdleState.cs
public class IdleState : ICharacterState
{
    public void EnterState(Character character)
    {
        Debug.Log("Entering Idle State");
        // Set idle animation
    }

    public void UpdateState(Character character)
    {
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space))
        {
            character.TransitionToState(character.JumpingState);
        }
        else if (Input.GetKey(KeyCode.W))
        {
            character.TransitionToState(character.RunningState);
        }
    }

    public void ExitState(Character character)
    {
        Debug.Log("Exiting Idle State");
    }
}
```

```csharp
// RunningState.cs
public class RunningState : ICharacterState
{
    public void EnterState(Character character)
    {
        Debug.Log("Entering Running State");
        // Set running animation
    }

    public void UpdateState(Character character)
    {
        if (Input.GetKeyUp(KeyCode.W))
        {
            character.TransitionToState(character.IdleState);
        }
    }

    public void ExitState(Character character)
    {
        Debug.Log("Exiting Running State");
    }
}
```
```csharp
// JumpingState.cs
public class JumpingState : ICharacterState
{
    public void EnterState(Character character)
    {
        Debug.Log("Entering Jumping State");
        // Set jumping animation
    }

    public void UpdateState(Character character)
    {
        if (character.IsGrounded)
        {
            character.TransitionToState(character.IdleState);
        }
    }

    public void ExitState(Character character)
    {
        Debug.Log("Exiting Jumping State");
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Implement the Context Class

```csharp
// Character.cs
public class Character : MonoBehaviour
{
    public ICharacterState IdleState { get; private set; }
    public ICharacterState RunningState { get; private set; }
    public ICharacterState JumpingState { get; private set; }

    private ICharacterState currentState;

    public bool IsGrounded { get; private set; }

    private void Awake()
    {
        IdleState = new IdleState();
        RunningState = new RunningState();
        JumpingState = new JumpingState();
    }

    private void Start()
    {
        TransitionToState(IdleState);
    }

    private void Update()
    {
        currentState.UpdateState(this);
    }

    public void TransitionToState(ICharacterState newState)
    {
        currentState?.ExitState(this);
        currentState = newState;
        currentState.EnterState(this);
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **State Interface**: `ICharacterState` defines the methods that all states must implement (`EnterState`, `UpdateState`, `ExitState`).
2. **Concrete States**: `IdleState`, `RunningState`, and `JumpingState` implement the `ICharacterState` interface and define specific behaviors for each state.
3. **Context Class**: `Character` manages the current state and transitions between states. It calls the appropriate state methods during the game loop (`Update` method).

### Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each state is encapsulated in its own class, making the code easier to manage and extend.
- **Flexibility**: Adding new states or changing existing ones is straightforward.
- **Maintainability**: The code is easier to read and maintain due to the clear separation of state-specific behavior.

This example demonstrates how the State Pattern can be effectively used in Unity to manage character states, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.
