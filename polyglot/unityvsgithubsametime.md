It is possible to use both Unity Version Control (formerly known as Plastic SCM) and GitHub within the same project. However, it requires careful management to avoid conflicts and ensure smooth operation. Here’s how you can set it up:

### Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Initialize Unity Version Control:**
   - Set up Unity Version Control for your project.
   - Ensure that Unity Version Control is properly configured and working.

2. **Initialize GitHub Repository:**
   - Create a new GitHub repository.
   - Initialize Git in your Unity project directory.
   - Add a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files.

3. **Configure Both Systems:**
   - Ensure that both version control systems are aware of each other’s presence.
   - Use `.gitignore` and Unity Version Control's ignore file to prevent conflicts.

### Detailed Steps

#### 1. Initialize Unity Version Control

1. Open your Unity project.
2. Go to **Window > Version Control**.
3. Follow the prompts to set up Unity Version Control (Plastic SCM) for your project.

#### 2. Initialize GitHub Repository

1. Open a terminal in your Unity project directory.
2. Initialize a Git repository:
   ```sh
   git init
   ```
3. Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files:
   ```sh
   touch .gitignore
   ```
4. Add the following to your `.gitignore` file to exclude Unity-specific files:
   ```plaintext
   [Ll]ibrary/
   [Tt]emp/
   [Oo]bj/
   [Bb]uild/
   [Bb]uilds/
   [Ll]ogs/
   [Uu]ser[Ss]ettings/
   *.csproj
   *.unityproj
   *.sln
   *.suo
   *.tmp
   *.user
   *.userprefs
   *.pidb
   *.booproj
   *.svd
   *.pdb
   *.mdb
   *.opendb
   *.VC.db
   *.pidb.meta
   *.pdb.meta
   *.mdb.meta
   *.opendb.meta
   *.VC.db.meta
   ```
5. Add and commit the initial files:
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```
6. Add the remote repository:
   ```sh
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   ```
7. Push the initial commit:
   ```sh
   git push -u origin main
   ```

#### 3. Configure Both Systems

1. **Unity Version Control Ignore File:**
   - Create a `.plasticignore` file in your project root.
   - Add the following to exclude Git-specific files:
     ```plaintext
     .git/
     .gitignore
     ```

2. **Git Ignore File:**
   - Ensure your `.gitignore` file excludes Unity Version Control files:
     ```plaintext
     .plastic/
     .plasticignore
     ```

### Example `.gitignore` and `.plasticignore` Files

**.gitignore**
```plaintext
[Ll]ibrary/
[Tt]emp/
[Oo]bj/
[Bb]uild/
[Bb]uilds/
[Ll]ogs/
[Uu]ser[Ss]ettings/
*.csproj
*.unityproj
*.sln
*.suo
*.tmp
*.user
*.userprefs
*.pidb
*.booproj
*.svd
*.pdb
*.mdb
*.opendb
*.VC.db
*.pidb.meta
*.pdb.meta
*.mdb.meta
*.opendb.meta
*.VC.db.meta
.plastic/
.plasticignore
```

**.plasticignore**
```plaintext
.git/
.gitignore
```

### Final Steps

1. Regularly commit and push changes to both version control systems.
2. Use Unity Version Control for detailed version tracking and branching.
3. Use GitHub for collaboration, pull requests, and remote backups.

By following these steps, you can effectively use both Unity Version Control and GitHub within the same project.
