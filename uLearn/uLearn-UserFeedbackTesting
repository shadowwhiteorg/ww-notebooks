# User Feedback & Testing

- User testing and feedback is an opportunity to `reality-check` your project — against the `user personas` you created during `pre-production` .
- Ideally `with real people`, who review your designs, prototypes, and the real-time 3D experience throughout the `development cycle`. 
-  It’s possible to get valuable information from informal feedback, user testing `isn’t just putting your product in front of someone and asking what they think`.
- It’s a structured process designed to get as much `specific and useful information` from the tester as possible.
- You might be tempted to think, `“It’s not ready yet — I’ll show this to people and get their feedback when it’s done!”` It’s likely you won’t be able to make big changes that the feedback might bring to light. 

 - `Test early and often!` The more you test and refine along the way, the better your end product will be. 

  - The user testing process typically follows this high level structure: 

    - Define the objectives.

    - Plan the session. 

    - Facilitate the session.

    - Evaluate the results.  

## Define the objectives:
- What yout want to learn about project?
- What you will show the user to elicit feedback;
    - Wireframes
    - Design mockups
    - Prototype 
    - etc.

## Define the questions 
- Depending on the type of feedback you’re looking for, you might ask `open-ended` questions, `closed-ended` questions, or a `combination` of both.

### Open-ended Questions
    - How well do you think the design addresses the main goal of character? 
    - What were the moments you felt confused, and why?
    - How would you improve this experience?

### Closed-ended questions have predetermined answers,
- A series of statements which the user will grade their response to, for example rating confidence on a `scale from 1 to 5`
- Questions with simple `Yes / No responses`

## Prepare yourself to run the session
- Observe rather than guide.
    - If user stucks at very basic point `wait at least 30 seconds` and note it down, after that explain what to do so that you can get more information from that session.
- Don't explain or justify your design choices
- Don't problem-solve during testing
    - Prepare yourself to `remain observational` role.

## Facilitating the Session

- Make introductions if testing as a group. 
- Identify the goal of the session. 
- Explain the recording policy (if applicable) and confirm the tester's consent to this.
- P- rovide the materials for testing, and observe the testers as they use or review them.
- Ask the questions you have prepared.
- Provide summaries of participant answers for clarification purposes. 
- Close the session.

### Tips and Tricks for facilitating:
    - Remind yourself that you are ot your product.
    - Frame the experience for participants. Remind them that negative feedback is more usefull than possitive feedback
    - When the testing begins, stop talking and record your observations. Do not rely on your memory.

## Mini product evaluation

#### 1.  Choose one or two products (digital or physical) that you think are particularly well made. For example, a game or software with a particularly good user experience, or a kitchen implement that’s stylish yet functional.

#### 2.  Try to identify why you like the product so much. Use the following questions to help you:
    - What user needs does it address for you?
    - What is positive about the experience for you as a user?
    - How do you feel when you use it?
    - How steep was the learning curve when you began to use it?
    - Would you recommend it to others? Extend this answer by identifying who precisely you would recommend it to, and your reason for doing so. 

#### 3.  This is a product that you like a lot, but take a moment to identify areas it has for improvement. Use the following questions to help you:
    - Do you have relevant user needs that it does not adequately address?
    - Do you have desires, rather than needs, that it does not address?
    - Are there areas where the experience of using it could be refined?
    - If you could say one thing to the people who designed and made the product, what would it be?
    
#### 4.  Take a moment to evaluate the feedback you’ve written up for the product. If you were part of the design and development team, would this give you enough information to:
    - Clearly identify the positive and negative aspects of the user’s experience of your product?
    - Begin to identify possible actions that might address any user pain points?
