# Portfolio

## What goes in a portfolio?

- A portfolio introduction provides an overview of your skills, training, career interests, goals, and relevant professional experience. It also outlines the projects included in the portfolio.
- An image or representative visual is featured on the welcome page of the portfolio.
- Narrative introductions to each project explain the ways the work demonstrates the critical skills for your chosen career areas.
- If the portfolio is focused on skill-growth, a learning plan identifies skills or concepts you might be lacking now, but want to gain in the near future.
- A download option is helpful, for either the full portfolio or an abridged version, in case potential employers, investors, or educators want to share your work with others.

## Planning of a Portfolio

Plan out your portfolio
Let's start to plan your portfolio content, design, and flow. Using a document, paper, or sticky notes to organize your thoughts:
- Create a list of the files and assets the portfolio will contain, and organize these into categories (for example, by skill, career or industry).
- Determine the design and navigation style of your portfolio.
- Draft an introduction or mission statement for your portfolio.
- Identify the additional content you will need to create or curate for the portfolio. For example:
- Text descriptions and reflections for each piece in your portfolio
- A learning plan that identifies skills or concepts you might be lacking now, but want to gain moving forward
- A slideshow on the front page or as part of the menu that briefly highlights the portfolio content

## Portfolio Guidance

Use the following questions to help you create, review, and refine your portfolio.

### Content

- What is the purpose of the portfolio? How does the purpose affect the type of content you should include?
- Who is the intended audience for the portfolio? How does the audience affect the type of content you should include?
- Can you identify any gaps in the available content?
- Consider how you expect a portfolio to change over time or how you might create several versions of the portfolio to accommodate different audiences.
- If you have an existing portfolio, is the current content relevant to the purpose and audience? If not, what should you remove, and what other projects should you include?
- Will your portfolio have a narrative? What story is this collection of projects, media, and content trying to tell? Should content be presented in a particular order?
- Where will the portfolio live? If the portfolio will be posted to a website that can be accessed publicly by anyone, take into account government regulations, school policies, and best practices with regard to your personal identification and information. Itï¿½s appropriate to consider what personal information to include or exclude, since a portfolio may be forwarded to unknown individuals.
- Is the language level appropriate for your intended audience?
- Does the portfolio's written content have any spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors?

### Design

- Uniformity and Consistency: Are elements repeated on content pages to help identify the portfolio as complete? What attributes of the portfolio maintain or violate consistency?
- Universal navigation: Where is the main navigation for the portfolio located, and does it appear universally?
- Layout: Is the layout logical, or do elements appear to be placed randomly?
- Links: Are links labeled clearly?
- Usability: Are portfolio visitors able to find information easily? If online, does the portfolio load quickly?
- Readability: Is there formatting that improves or reduces readability?
- Accessibility: Are all images labeled with alternative text (alt-text)? Are the text and titles clear and easy to read for all viewers (color, size, and so on)? What features can or cannot be read by screen readers?

Because a portfolio constantly evolves, be sure you plan the portfolio structure to allow for easy changes and additions.
